//VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”
const aNum = 8;
const bNum = 6;
console.log (aNum);
console.log(bNum);
console.log ("the difference between 8 and 6 is 2.");

// I have no idea how yall want me to code this? hard code with me giving the
//answers or the computer using the code in order to figure it out.

console.log (`the difference betweeen anum and bnum is ${aNum - bNum}.`)
