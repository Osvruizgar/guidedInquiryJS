//HARD: Create 4 math functions, one called add() that adds 2 numbers, one called subtract() that subtracts 2 numbers, one called multiply() tomultiply 2 numbers, and one called divide() to divide two numbers.
function add(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
};

function subtract(bobby, dan) {
    console.log(bobby - dan);
};

function multiply(water, bottle) {
    console.log(water * bottle);
};

function divide(java, script) {
    console.log(java / script);
};
//a = 10 and b = 5. Function is made to add the two.
add(10, 5);
//bobby = 10 and dan = 3. Function subtracts the two.
subtract(10, 3);
// water = 10 and bottle = 4. function subtracts the two.
multiply(10, 4);
// java = 10 and script = 2. 
divide(10, 2);
// functions should have names that represent what the function is or does but this is for a reminder.
// I have these meaningless names to help me out so they do have a meaning. it reminds me that the names in a function are empty variables.
